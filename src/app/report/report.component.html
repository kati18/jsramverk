# MeAngular

I have chosen Angular as framework and platform for my Me-application. Although I have heard itÂ´s big and hard to learn I really like the fact that its supposed to be very clear, strictly structured with lots of built-in features and therefore hopefully also used in the same way by different developers.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.0.
After installing the Angular CLI I used the command ng new me-angular --routing to generate a basic Angular app with an app routing module(AppRoutingModule).
I also installed ngx-markdown library to be able to parse the static markdown in READ.md directly from the HTML markup in the report component.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
